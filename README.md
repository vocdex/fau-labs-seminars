This repository contains the code for Machine Learning and Systems Lab and Selected Topics in Machine Learning Seminar at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg.

# Machine Learning and Systems Lab

## [Lab 4](./ml_systems_lab/lab_04)
Building a Flask server for serving a pre-trained PyTorch model and showing the gradient activation map. The idea is to build this server in an embedded device, such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.


# Selected Topics in Machine Learning

## [Diffusion Models beat GANs on Image Synthesis](./selected_topics_ml/diffusion_models_beat_gans)
Here there is an overview, and some code for playing around with diffusion models.
